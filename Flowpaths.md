# Flowpath Runs

### Slope definitions

The flowpath slope definitions are constructed by watershed_abstraction routine in wepppy. For each cell in a hillslope a flowpath is constructed by walking down the slope identified by the slope grid from topaz. A distance array is constructed from the pixel coordinates and the slope points are truncated to 19 by linear interpolation if more than 19 points are defining the slope.

### Soils, Managements, and Climates

Flowpath runs use the soil, management, and climate of their parent hillslope.

### Gridded Output

Each flowpath is ran through wepp and a plot file is generated by wepp. This file contains distance downslope, elevation, and soil deposition/loss (loss is positive). The soil dep/loss is interpolated against the normalized distance points from the flowpaths slope file to obtain a estimate at each pixel value. Many flowpaths might run through a particular cell. The dep/loss estimates are aggregated by taking the average of the non-zero values at each cell.
